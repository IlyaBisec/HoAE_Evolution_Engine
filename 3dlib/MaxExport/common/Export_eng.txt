A. The following elements are ejected from the hierarchy of transformation for export,
together with all the child nodes:
In Max:
- Biped Footsteps
In Maya:
- Standard camera top, persp, left, front
- GroundPlane_transform
- All IkHandles, IkEffectors

Two. Static objects (which do not change their position in principle - shrubs, trees)
better zakombaynit one object - it will significantly speed up export animation scene.

Three. Where this is not particularly affect the quality of the animation, do linear animation
curves.

4. All objects that are not part of the scene - supporting the camera, light sources,
curves (including hidden), you must kill, lest they hung a dead weight.
Hidden object is also exported. In spite of its invisibility.

Five. Try to separate the skin all the polygons have the same material (texture).

6. When you bind skin to the bones (Physique in Max, BindSkin in Maya) first attempt to better
set a limit on the maximum of two dice on top, and only if it is
look sverhurodlivo - to increase the maximum number of bindings. Maximally
possible amount of weight on top - 4, but use a number of
recommended only in compelling cases, such as detailed facial animation.
